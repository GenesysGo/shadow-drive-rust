# NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE DEPLOYED CODE
This crate is a clone with updated anchor dependencies,
allowing for interfacing with the program while not forcing upstream
code to use legacy dependencies to match what is deployed.
For the actual deployed program code,
see https://docs.rs/crate/shadow-drive-user-staking/1.1.1/source/
